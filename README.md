# Rainmeter ToDo List

Simple ToDo list originaly made by xtcvv2 & balala (credit to them) that I modified a bit to enable the memorising of the variables.

## Installing

* Download and place entire `ToDo` folder in your Rainmeter skins location
* Activate `ToDo` skin
    * I do this by right-clicking on an already active skin to bring up the Rainmeter menu
    * Navigate to `Rainmeter > Skins > rainmeter-todo-list > todo > todo.ini`
        * If you do not see `rainmeter-todo-list` in the skin selection, try navigating to `Rainmeter > Refresh all`
